# InputUserName
HTML,CSS, and Javascript will be used.
The plan here is to create a page where 
1. The user will enter a username
2. Users chosen name will display in the center of the page and will be prompted to confirm the name.
3. If user confirms, the name will be used for the Welcome greeting.
4. The user when they leave the the page, the site should remember the username still.
